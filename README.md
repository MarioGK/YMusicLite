# YMusicLite

A modern YouTube playlist manager and downloader built with Blazor Server and MudBlazor.

## Features
 * Lightweight and fast

## Google / YouTube Authentication

YMusicLite now uses a desktop-style OAuth flow with only a public Google OAuth Client ID:

Client ID: `198027251119-c04chsbao214hcplsf697u2smo682vuq.apps.googleusercontent.com`

We request only the `youtube.readonly` scope to read your private playlists. Tokens (access & refresh) are securely stored in the local LiteDB database along with granted scopes. A minimal PKCE structure is in place; due to current library limitations the code verifier is reserved for future enhancement.

After authenticating via `/auth`, your private playlists are fetched and displayed. You can revoke access, and the application will handle token refresh automatically when near expiry.

### Multi-Account Support
You can add multiple YouTube accounts. The authentication page lists existing authenticated accounts and lets you switch between them. Each account is keyed by its YouTube Channel ID rather than a transient state value for stability.

### Resilience & Retries
The token exchange now includes exponential backoff (up to 4 attempts) for transient Google errors (5xx, 429, internal_failure). This improves reliability when Google's OAuth endpoints experience intermittent issues.

### PKCE Persistence
The PKCE code_verifier is now stored briefly (15 minutes) in the local database. This allows you to start authentication, restart the app (or reload the server), and still successfully complete the callback without losing the verifier. After a successful (or attempted) token exchange the verifier entry is deleted. Expired entries are cleaned up opportunistically.

If you encounter the error `client_secret is missing` during token exchange, verify that:
1. The OAuth client in Google Cloud Console is of type "Desktop app" (Installed application)
2. You're using the correct public client ID shown above
3. The redirect URI you supply matches exactly what you passed when building the authorization URL
4. You are not reusing an already consumed authorization code
